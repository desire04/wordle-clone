# Project 1 - *Wordle Simulator*

**Wordle Simulator** is an app that simulates a game of wordle. A player has 6 trials to guess a 5-letter word. For each guess, if a letter is not in the word, it gets colored black. If the letter is in the word but at the wrong position, it gets colored yellow. Finally, if the letter is in the word and at the right position, it gets colored green. The player wins the round if they manage to guess the right word before their trials run out.  

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Notes

The major challenge was reading through the files and understanding how the code worked. Once that was done, I was able to interact with the methods given to me pretty well.
